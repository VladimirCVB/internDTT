# DTT Intern Test Project

This is an assignment received from DTT to test my knowledge regarding back-end web development. It is based on the [Phalcon PHP](https://phalcon.io/en-us) framework and consists of a fully operational API. Within the committed files you will find Models, Migrations, Controllers, configs, a router and a .sql file which helps with easily creating the [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database used for this project. Moreover, the [Faker](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/) library and [mysql-db-seed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql-db-seed) with JavaScript  has been used to seed the database with fake data, consisting of 150 houses, 300 rooms, 150 house filters, 50 users and 150 listings.
